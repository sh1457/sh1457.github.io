## Hello! I'm Sujith Sudarshan

I'm interested in Data, Design, Dilemmas. I design data-driven solutions as a technology consultant. My interests are:

- python,
- zig,
- game design,
- data visualization
- performance optimization.

I like problem-solving and plan to use this blog to showcase it. This blog will contain a slice of everything from:

- dev-logs,
- travel-logs,
- how-tos,
- reviews,
- and my thoughts.

Take a look at my work and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
