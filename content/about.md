### Hello! I'm Sujith and I'm a data engineer from Bengaluru, India.

I'm interested in data, design, chess, and writing. I love solving problems with technology.

I'm currently working as a consultant at Deloitte. My work involves designing data driven solutions with Python and
PySpark. I have been reading a lot about python, zig, creating games from scratch, performance optimization.

Ever since I met my first computer at 9, I felt that techonology and making things with it was fun. I knew then that the
future requires us to use technology to make our lives better.

After studying Information science and engineering for my undergraduate degree, I began learning more and more about the
industry - frontend, backend, systems. But really, working with data seems like the most atomic thing irrespective of
tech stack or domain.

Take a look at my work below to see what I'm working on, and get in touch if you'd like to work together!
