This year has been a rollercoaster of emotions. From the joy of bringing home a pup `Arya` to the frustration of being
stuck of `home`, from the pursuit of `productivity` to just being present in the `moment`.

There comes a time in an year where you decide to hit the road for a couple of days and go on an adventure. This one
will always be special because it's Arya's 1st road trip and he has so much to see in the world. Being rescued from the
streets during a pandemic, happy memories were likely not many. But he is such a brave-heart. We wanted to let him
experience nature and get away from the city.

There is so much that he couldn't have seen in the city, like waterfalls, rivers, mountains, forests, etc. The plan was
to cover as many unique experiences as we could in 4 days. Another challenge was to make sure that our accommodation let
us bring pets.

So after careful deliberation, mom fixed on the Saklehpura Kalasa Mudigere region. There's no shortage of homestays,
many of which were pet-friendly. Quite a few farmstays had dogs of their own on the job.

#### Day 1

We left Bengaluru at the break of dawn. The plan was to get to Belur and visit the Chennakesava temple, an ancient
architectural marvel. We were worried about how Arya would take the journey. It was his first time travelling long
distance by car. We did have some pro-biotic sachets to add to his water and nausea medications at standby. But he did
way better than anyone expected.

After a quick breakfast pit stop, we reached Belur promptly. The stretch from Nelamangala-Hassan-Belur is perfect to
drive on mornings since you catch the sunrise behind you. We took turns car-sitting with Arya while exploring the
temple.

The sculptures and carvings in this ancient millennium old temple are so intricate and layered that you feel that it was
3d printed. Simply priceless. All the more if you imagine the capital, scale and skill of the crew required to build
this. There are so many challenges that are tough to do even with today's modern tools and equipment. There is a video
that does more justice than my words can.
