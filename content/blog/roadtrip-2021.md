This year has been a rollercoaster of emotions. From the joy of bringing home a pup to the frustration of being sick of
home, from the pursuit of productivity to just being present in the moment.

There comes a time in an year where you decide to hit the road for a couple of days and go on an adventure. This one
will always be special because it's Arya's 1st road trip and he has so much to see in the world. Being rescued from the
streets during a pandemic, happy memories were likely not many. But he is such a brave-heart. We wanted to let him
experience nature and get away from the city.

There is so much that he couldn't have seen in the city, like waterfalls, rivers, mountains, forests, etc. The plan was
to cover as many unique experiences as we could in 4 days. Another challenge was to make sure that our accommodation let
us bring pets.

So after careful deliberation, mom fixed on the Saklehpura Kalasa Mudigere region. There's no shortage of homestays,
many of which were pet-friendly. Quite a few farmstays had their own dog on the job.
