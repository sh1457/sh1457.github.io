## Hello! I'm Sujith Sudarshan.

I'm interested in **D**ata, **D**esign and **D**ilemnas.

I'm currently working as a technology consultant. My work involves designing data driven solutions. I have been
interested in reading about python, zig, game design, performance optimization.

Ever since I met my first computer at 9, I felt that technology and making things with it was fun. That's when I knew
that the future requires us to use technology to make our lives better.

Take a look at my work below to see what I'm working on, and get in touch if you'd like to work together!
