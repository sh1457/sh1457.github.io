## Hey! I'm Sujith Sudarshan. Welcome!

Being a potter-head, this site is designed with magic. Don't believe me, hover over the logo.

This is my remembrall, a place where I write my thoughts and designs before I forget them causing my remembrall to glow red.

Click on the link `blog` to see what I've written, I write about life, tech, design and all sorts of muggle-verse things.

Click on the link `about` to know more about me and if you want to get in touch.
