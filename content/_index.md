## Welcome to my Remembrall!

This site is designed with **magic**. If you don't believe me, mouse over (long-tap for those who don't have mice) the Remembrall.

This is my Remembrall[^1], where I write my thoughts and designs before I forget them.

Visit my ***blog*** to see what I've written. I write about life, tech, design - all sorts of muggle-verse things.

Look at ***about*** to know more about me and if you want to get in touch.

> A Remembrall is a glass ball the size of a large marble that reminds its owner if he or she has forgotten something. It is full of white smoke, which turns scarlet if the person who is holding it has forgotten something. ~ [pottermore](https://pottermore.fandom.com/wiki/Remembrall)

If you are a fellow potter-head and you haven't registered on [wizarding world](https://www.wizardingworld.com/). Definitely check it out!
